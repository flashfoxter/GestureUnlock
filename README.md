# GestureUnlock
Unlock your Mac using a trackpad gesture. Gesture Unlock is a hackathon project created at MHacks 6 in September 2015. It allows you to unlock your Mac by drawing a picture password using your mouse or trackpad rather than entering a password. It uses the [$1 gesture recognition algorithm](https://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/) for determining whether the shape is correct or not. It's pretty hacky and not really ready for any kind of release.

GestureUnlock uses [MultistrokeGestureRecognizer-iOS](https://github.com/britg/MultistrokeGestureRecognizer-iOS) for gesture recognition.
